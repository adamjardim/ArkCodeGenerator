"+++How to use this document+++

++Reading the map name++
You will find a line denoted by a "#Map" text.  Below this line, you will see the name of the map.
The regions in this document match the regions found on this map.  If you wish to change the map, please
re-run the createTemplateConfig executable and choose the new map you desire.

++Reading the region names++
Below the map name, you will see a line denoted by a "#Regions" text.  Below this line, you will see all the
regions for this map printed, preceded by a "= ".  

* If hand-edited, please be aware that any region names that do not match the proper name exactly will not be 
generated properly on the server.

Below the region name, you will also see a line denoted looking similar to this: (0.20,0.02) or some other pair
of numbers.  The first number represents the entry weight for each dino in this region.  The second number
represents the max percentage to allow for each dino in this region.  These will have been automatically 
generated from the createTemplateConfig executable.  These can be manually changed, but make sure they are 
actually numbers.

++Choosing dinos for each reason++
Below the entry weight and max percentage line, you will see a list of numbers separated by a "," like so:
0,5,10,20,30

These numbers represent the dinos that will appear in this region.  Please manually change these numbers to
the desired dinosaurs to appear in this region.  Please refer to the dinolist document provided in the same 
directory as the createTemplateConfig executable for the dino numbers.  Any number of dinosaurs may appear,
but please separate each dino number with a ","
